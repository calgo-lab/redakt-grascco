For developing NER models based on [GraSCCo](https://zenodo.org/records/11502329) corpus.

GraSCCo - short for Graz Synthetic Clinical Text Corpus - is a German-language clinical dataset designed to support research in clinical Natural Language Processing (cNLP), especially for Named Entity Recognition (NER).

These documents underwent rigorous alienation steps - textual paraphrasing, anonymization, and restructuring - to remove any privacy-sensitive information derived from real clinical texts. This transformation allows GraSCCo to be fully shareable with no legal restrictions.

To evaluate its utility, GraSCCo was compared to other real, non-shareable clinical corpora. The study found that GraSCCo captures sufficient linguistic characteristics to approximate real clinical language use - making it an effective resource for training clinical language models, though not necessarily domain-specific models.
